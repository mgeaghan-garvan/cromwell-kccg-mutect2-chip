To build an annovar docker image, first download the annovar tar.gz archive
from https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/ into this directory.

Next, extract the archive, and ensure that the annovar Perl executables are located
at annovar/*.pl.

Finally, build the image with:

  docker build -t annovar:latest .
